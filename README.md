## Usage

Generate the dataset of airfoil + hole:

```bash
cd airfoil
python build_data.py
```

Generate the dataset of superformula + ellipse:

```bash
cd superformula
python build_data.py
```

Train/evaluate:

```bash
python main.py
```

positional arguments:
    
```
mode	startover, continue or evaluate
data	airfoil or superformula

```

optional arguments:

```
-h, --help            	show this help message and exit
--train_steps		training steps
--save_interval 	number of intervals for saving the trained model and plotting results
```
